            <h1>Deadrop.org</h1>
            <p>Transfer end-to-end post quantum encrypted digital packages comprising of messages and documents of unlimited size using anonymous aliases.</p>

        </div>
        <p>Optionally associate an email address with an alias if you do want to be known and to make it easier for people to find you.</p>
        <p>An alias looks like this: <code>missouri-precise-samsung.deadrop.org</code></p>
        <p>However you can run your own Dead Drop server on your own domain, so an alias could look like this: <code>missouri-precise-samsung.yourowndomain.org</code></p>
        <p>The only restriction is that both the sender alias and the recipient alias must share the same Dead Drop domain.</p>
        <p>You can have as many aliases as you like, each one is associated with an encrypted private key on your computer and your public key listed on a Dead Drop server.</p>
        <p>To send someone a digital package you need to know their alias only.</p>
        <h2>Dead Pack's</h2>
        <p>Dead Drop digital packages are called DeadPack's. A DeadPack is Post Quantum encrypted along with traditional asymmetric encryption methods.</p>
        <a href="https://github/rob-linton/deadrop/wiki/Encryption">More about encryption</a>
        <p>Only the recipient alias can decrypt and unpack a DeadPack.</p>
        <p>Dead Drop also provides a method to transfer DeadPack's anonymously on your behalf, because how do you send a DeadPack if you don't know someone's email address?</p>
        <p>You can also run your own private Dead Drop server in AWS, (you need an AWS account as Dead Drop uses AWS S3 and AWS Simple Mail Service)</p>
