- Allow destination alias to be in a different domain

- How to authenticate when sending?

- Aliases now look like emails. If the email domain is in the whitelist then just add the front bit infront of the @ symbol, otherwise add the whole email address. .'s get replaced by dashes, dashes get replaced with -- dashes. 

- Don't make it open source, but supply the source on request to verified recipients.

- publickeyserver.org always adds the full email address in front. 

- Limit publickeyserver.org to gmail, hotmail, apple etc accounts only, no company accounts.

- Add a secondary authentication process for non whitelisted emaial domains

- add a blacklist option to the .env file

- add the option for a root CA for sending between keyservers
