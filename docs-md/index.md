## What is PublicKeyServer?

PublicKeyServer is a next-generation secure file transfer platform that implements the **Anonymous Certificate Enrollment (ACE)** protocol. It provides end-to-end encrypted file sharing with optional anonymous identity capabilities, designed as a modern, user-friendly alternative to PGP.

> **Key Innovation:** PublicKeyServer combines military-grade encryption with consumer-grade simplicity. Users get memorable three-word aliases (like `happy-cloud-tree.publickeyserver.org`) instead of complex key fingerprints, while benefiting from post-quantum cryptography that protects against future threats.

### Core Components

- **SureDrop Server:** REST API server providing certificate management and encrypted file relay
- **SurePack Client:** Cross-platform CLI and GUI for creating, sending, and receiving encrypted packages
- **ACE Protocol:** Anonymous certificate system based on EST (RFC7030) principles
- **Hybrid Encryption:** AES-256-GCM + RSA-2048 + Kyber1024 (quantum-resistant)

### Key Features

End-to-End Encryption | Post-Quantum Ready | Anonymous Option | No Key Management | Perfect Forward Secrecy | Zero-Knowledge Server | Integrated Delivery | Digital Signatures
